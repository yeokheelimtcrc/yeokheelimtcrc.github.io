    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>Teochew Opera, a dazzling gem in the crown of traditional Chinese performing arts, draws its soul from the Teochew dialect, harmoniously blending elegant singing, exquisite craftsmanship, and rich local characteristics. Like a vibrant tapestry, it embodies both the subtle refinement cherished by scholars and the approachable warmth that resonates with common people, emerging as an artistic treasure where music, dance, and theater intertwine.</p>
    <p>Since the nineteenth century, following the footsteps of Teochew immigrants voyaging overseas, this cultural essence traveled across the seas to Singapore, where it took root and flourished, becoming one of the most influential Chinese regional theatrical forms abroad. Examining the nearly 200-year evolution of Teochew Opera in Singapore, we witness how it has persevered through changing times and turbulent eras, and how generations of Teochew opera artists have passed on their cultural heritage while pioneering innovations in the modern age. This captivating cultural history illustrates how overseas Teochew communities have both preserved and reinvented their traditional theatrical art form.</p>

    <h2>I. The First Notes: Oral Tradition and Street Performances (......19th Century)</h2>
    <p>How did Teochew Opera first take root in Singapore? Li ZhongJue’s 1887 “The Customs of Singapore” provided the first written account of this history: “the troupes consist of both men and women. There are about four to five troupes north of the Singapore River, and one to two troupes south of the river. There are also Cantonese, Fuzhou and Teochew opera.” This reveals that Teochew Opera had already appeared in Singapore's theaters during that time.</p>  
    <p>Before the establishment of formal theaters, Teochew Opera had already been quietly circulating among the people. According to Teo Liang Chye’s “Teochew Opera in Singapore”, as night fell, Teochew immigrants would often gather together, playing string instruments and listening to traditional melodies to ease their homesickness. This form of oral transmission became an important channel for the earliest spread of Teochew Opera in Southeast Asia. </p>
    <p>Street Operas (Wayang) provided another avenue for Teochew Opera at that time. During temple festivals and deity celebrations, opera troupes would set up temporary stages on the streets, bringing the art form into more people’s lives through these mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>In the mid to late 19th century, Chinese Teochew Opera troupes traveling south to make a living began touring throughout Southeast Asia. By the early 20th century, Teochew Opera troupes had established a significant presence in Singapore. Lau Peng Ser, one of the veteran of the Er Woo Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association, said that when he had arrived in Singapore in 1911, there were already several opera troupes here, including Lau Sai Yong Hong Troupe, Lau Sai Thor Guan Temple, Lau Buan Seng Troupe and Chea Lung Lau Gek Lau Choon Troupe.</p>

    <h2>II. Growing in Glory: From the Golden Age to the Impact of War (1900-1958)</h2>
    <p>With Singapore's booming economy in the early 20th century, Teochew Opera entered its first golden age. Between 1920 and 1940, numerous professional Teochew Opera troupes arrived in Singapore and toured throughout Nanyang. By 1938, the famous Chea Lung Lau Gek Lau Choon Troupe had established a per manent theater at Hill Street. During this period, Teochew Opera flourished in diverse ways: professional troupes grew increasingly larger, often employing more than sixty performers and staff.</p>
    <p>Amateur Musical Associations and Opera Troupes also emerged in abundance, contributing significantly to the study of Teochew music and the preservation of the art form. These troupes were active not only in Singapore’s entertainment venues and temple festivals but also frequently performed charity shows to raise funds for disaster relief in China, demonstrating their deep patriotic sentiments.</p>
    <p>Performance venues at that time included permanent ones like Purpose-built Opera theaters, Amusement parks, and Theatre, or temporary ones that were built to hold performances for religious offerings or celebrations. Teochew Opera art penetrates into every corner of society. Particularly from 1920 to 1930, Teochew Opera in Singapore and Malaya reached its peak, with powerful troupes performing one after another, their fierce competition bringing even more vitality to the theatrical scene.</p>
    <p>However, after Singapore fell in 1942, this flourishing theatrical landscape suffered severe damage. During the Japanese occupation, social unrest, coupled with the impact of emerging entertainment forms, forced many Teochew Opera troupes to close or relocate, gradually dimming their former glory.</p>

    <h2>III. Spotlight: The Silver Screen Era of Teochew Opera (1959-1963)</h2>
    <p>In September 1959, the first Teochew Opera film, “The Burning of Riverside Tower” premiered in Singapore, opening a new chapter in Teochew Opera development. This wave of Teochew Opera films quickly swept through Singapore, propelling the art form into its second golden age. Within a short five-year period, a steady stream of Teochew Opera films poured into Singapore, triggering a viewing frenzy.</p>
    <p>Among them, the sensational release of “So Luk Neung” stands as a classic example: in just one week, it achieved the remarkable feat of 107 consecutive screenings and attracted 100,000 viewers. By early 1961, the film had broken both Chinese and Western box office records with an astonishing 593 screenings over 72 days.</p>
    <p>This Teochew Opera film craze not only stimulated creative enthusiasm among local traditional troupes and community organizations, inspiring them to adapt screen classics to the stage, but also gave rise to new amateur societies such as the Nam Hwa Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association. The unprecedented prosperity in the film industry even led to phenomena such as “The directly competing”,“duplicating” and “remaking phenomenon” , showcasing the vibrant “spotlight” in Singapore's post-war Teochew Opera scene.</p>

    <h2>IV. Changing Fortunes: Transformation and Challenges After Independence (1963-1979)</h2>
    <p>After Singapore's independence, Teochew Opera developed new characteristics under a stable social environment and with government support for cultural development. During this period, Teochew Opera troupes underwent a shift in identity, transitioning from pre-war allegiance to China as their motherland to serving local society by actively participating in community charity performances.</p>
    <p>In the late 1970s, spurred by Singapore Television, amateur and professional troupes collaborated to produce 65 Teochew dialect television dramas. These included Nam Hwa Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association's “The Trail of Qing Eng”, “Embedding Love in Drama” and “The Gift of a Sword from Princess Baihua”; Er Woo Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association’s “The Lotus Lamp” and “Lee Sam-neung”; Chit Hoon Teochew Opera Troupe's “The fairy and the Man” and “Lady General Mu Guiying”; and Lau Sai Thor Guan’s “The grand homecoming”. These productions pioneered new forms of Teochew Opera. Simultaneously, Singapore’s Teochew Opera community frequently exchanged ideas with troupes from Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, displaying vibrant vitality through mutual learning.</p>
    <p>However, Teochew Opera faced numerous challenges during this period: professional troupes abandoned permanent theaters in favor of street opera performances and deity worship shows; Malaysia’s tightened performance policies restricted cross-border performances; and new parking lot regulations prohibited the use of ancestral house parking lots for street opera performances, further reducing available venues. Combined with the impact of Western culture and younger generations' disconnection from the art form, a crisis of succession gradually emerged.</p>
    <p>In 1979, with the launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign, Teochew Opera temporarily disappeared from television screens. Yet exchanges between local and overseas groups intensified, with troupes like Hong Kong’s Sin Tian Chye Teochew Opera Troupe making multiple visits that sparked renewed interest in Teochew Opera. During this transformative period, the social function of Teochew Opera shifted from traditional deity worship to showcasing local cultural characteristics. To preserve traditional culture and promote regional opera development, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Board jointly organized Chinese regional opera performances, measures that to some extent rescued the declining Teochew Opera scene.</p>

    <h2>V. Turning Tides：Transformation and Innovation in a New Era (1980-2018)</h2>
    <p>Since the 1980s, with rapid economic and technological development, Teochew Opera’s development model has undergone fundamental changes. During urbanization, traditional village temples were renovated or merged, street opera performance venues gradually disappeared, and traditional professional troupes slowly faded away as they lost their survival space. However, this period witnessed the rise of amateur troupes, such as Er Woo Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association presenting original scripts and anniversary performances, and Nam Hwa Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association participating in official regional opera activities and actively collaborating with other community Teochew Opera organizations for joint performances. These community amateur troupes actively explored new performance spaces, appearing in community centers, schools, nursing homes, markets, libraries, and parks, promoting Teochew Opera through innovative approaches.</p>
    <p>To address talent shortages, Singapore’s Teochew Opera community strengthened international exchanges and cooperation. Many renowned overseas groups were invited to perform in Singapore, while local troupes also ventured abroad, showcasing Singapore’s unique style. Meanwhile, amateur groups effectively utilized internet technology to build communication platforms, attracting new generations of audiences and performers, injecting fresh vitality into the traditional art form.</p>
    <p>Government and community organization support has been invaluable. The National Arts Council established a “Seed Grant” to subsidize non-profit arts groups, while the government created a “One-for-One” Cultural Matching Fund, promoting the development and transformation of Teochew Opera organizations like Nam Hwa Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association. Regional organizations such as the Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan and the Jieyang Association Teochew Opera Troupe, along with societies like Ngee Ann Kongsi and Chui Huay Lim Club, actively introduced Chinese Teochew Opera troupes to Singapore, jointly promoting the dissemination and development of Teochew Opera culture.</p>
    <p>In this new era, Teochew Opera not only serves an entertainment function but also shoulders the important mission of social education and cultural inheritance, demonstrating vibrant vitality that moves with the times.</p>

    <h2>VI. A Century in Retrospect: Inheritance and Transformation</h2>
    <p>The over two-hundred-year development of Teochew Opera in Singapore resembles a lingering melody, continuously performing within the symphony of Singapore’s cultural landscape. From its beginnings as a cultural link for overseas Teochew people to express their nostalgia, to becoming an indispensable Chinese artistic treasure in Singapore’s multicultural mosaic today, Teochew Opera has remained intimately connected to the destiny of this land.</p>
    <p>Throughout this long transformation process, Singapore’s Teochew Opera has gradually developed its own unique character. Local elements have been ingeniously incorporated into costume selection and plot arrangements, such as the Nam Hwa Amateur Musical and Dramatic Association’s groundbreaking production “Matchmaking At The Five-Foot Way” which reflected Singapore’s local life and depicted the harmonious coexistence of its diverse ethnic groups and citizens helping one another; the incorporation of high-tech special effects in the newly adapted martial arts Teochew Opera “The Severing Sword”; and Dr. Chua Soo Pong adapted the Indian epic "Ramayana" into the Teochew opera "Fang Shan Jie," which premiered in Germany in 1991 by the Thau Yong Amateur Musical Association. These works showcase the exquisite combination of tradition and innovation. Performance formats have also evolved from the early dominance of professional troupes to today’s diverse dissemination model primarily led by community amateur groups.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Singapore’s Teochew Opera still faces limitations in areas such as creation, scriptwriting, and directing, which remain relatively dependent on external support, presenting challenges that Singapore’s Teochew Opera community must address in its future development. Looking ahead, the inheritance and innovation of Singapore’s Teochew Opera not only requires government support and community organizations’ efforts but also calls for the participation of the younger generation to inject new vitality into this ancient art form.</p>
    <p>Teochew Opera and Singapore share an inseparable cultural bond. The continuation of this relationship requires the dedicated nurturing of each one of us, ensuring that this artistic flower blooming in the Southern Seas will forever emanate its fragrance.</p>
